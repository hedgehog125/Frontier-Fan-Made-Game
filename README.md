# Frontier-Fan-Made-Game
A 2d space shooter game made using Phaser.

Several years ago I was a fan of a [Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/58976080/) with the same name. This game is heavily inspired by it. 

# Installation

# A Note on the Code
If you want to read the code, check out the master branch instead of the main. I mixed something up when publishing the abandoned version and it got split into 2 branches.
